        # Intuition
        # 1. Build undirected graph using edges
        # 2. Loop through all the nodes (not from keys of graph but directly from 0 - n-1
        #     (because a node that does not connect to any other node would not exist in the edges
        #     dfs to find all the nodes that are connected to it (maintaining visited)
        #     whenever I encounter a note not in visited, itâ€™s the beginning of a new 
        #     connected component
        # Test cases:
        # n = 1
        # 0,1 not connected (this cannot be because 1 <= edges.length <= 5000)
        # 0,1 connected edges=[[0,1]]
        # Examples provided by the problem
